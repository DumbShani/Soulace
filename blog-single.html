                <h3>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring
                    which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which
                    was created for the bliss of souls like mine.</h3>

                <p class="py-4">I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
                    existence, that I
                    neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet
                    I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.</p>

                <p> When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the
                    upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the
                    inner
                    sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to
                    the
                    earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among
                    the
                    stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I
                    feel
                    the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love
                    which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend,
                    when
                    darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power,
                    like
                    the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these
                    conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might
                    be
                    the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!
